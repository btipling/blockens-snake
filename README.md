A snake like game that I'm using as project to learn OpenGL.

Dependencies:

OpenGL support for version 4.1
Probably a 64 bit CPU.

glfw for UI and keyboard interaction.
libpng which also zlip

All the code is written by me except for `png_texture_load` function which is a png loader
and was written by [David Grayson](https://github.com/DavidEGrayson/ahrs-visualizer).
